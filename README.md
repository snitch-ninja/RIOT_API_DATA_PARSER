# RIOT_API_DATA_PARSER
This Visual Studio 2015 C Program loops through 1000 matches in a match repository, like the Black Market Brawler match repos that were given out for the API challenge.
<br /><br />
See the comments in <code>&lt;main.c&gt;</code> for a more detailed explaination; collapsing the <code>if(1){}</code>'s and top level <code>for(...){}</code> loops inside <code>int main(...){}</code> provides a more readable experience.

I have changed my API key, so the one inside <code>&lt;main.c&gt;</code> does not work.
